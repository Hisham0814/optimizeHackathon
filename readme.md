We are giving https://pue.kar.nic.in a complete UI overhaul as we feel it is long overdue.
Thousands if not millions of students use the website and it is important that they can get to where they want to be, as easy as possible.
We chose this particular site as we ourselves had to use this website when we were in PU and felt is was a big hassle to navigate the website.
The original website was very clunky and non responsive and just wasn't very visually pleasing. We have taken a more modern approach to the UI and made it feel more intuitive and easier on the eyes.
The white, gray and purple colour scheme was making it look old and we replaced it with a more vibrant purple and yellow scheme.
We have also added a dark mode feature that makes sure it isnt too bright when people access the site at night.
We have given direct links to the result pages as we felt the redirection to the results home page was unnecessary and this makes it easier to use.
We also felt that there were too many links and text cluttering the page and we have replaced some of it with interactive buttons and more images.
The PUC website should be a place where our youth feel motivated to study and achieve their goals. We at Team Pineapple have tried our best to make it as visually stimulating as possible.
